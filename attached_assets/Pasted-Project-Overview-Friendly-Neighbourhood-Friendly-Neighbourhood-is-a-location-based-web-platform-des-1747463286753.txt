Project Overview: Friendly Neighbourhood
Friendly Neighbourhood is a location-based web platform designed to strengthen local communities by making it easy for people to request and offer help within their area. Whether someone needs assistance moving furniture, borrowing tools, tutoring, or finding a pet sitter — this app allows neighbors to connect and collaborate safely and conveniently.
